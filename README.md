# dam-levels

Cape Town is currently in the grips of a devastating draught. It could be the first city in modern history to see its taps literally run dry. The severity of the situation makes understanding it important. The more informed we are, the better prepared we will be. And helping people appreciate how low our supply of water is will encourage them to be more vigilant in saving it. It's pretty scary stuff but the more we know, the more effectively we can solve the problem.

My findings are outlined in a notebook, which is best viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jbertscher/dam-levels/blob/master/0.1-exploratory-analysis-of-dam-levels.ipynb). My data munging, data processing, and preliminary analysis can also be found in this repo.

__In summary, I find that:__
- 'Day zero' will likely occur around 16 May 2018 at the time of writing, assuming current consumption levels and that the government does not step in before then (which they will).
- At current consumption levels, 363GL<sup>*</sup> is the absolute minimum dam level needed going into next summer to avoid running out of water.
- If we run out of water this year but have a good rainy season, we could expect the dams to reach the minimum required level to avoid running out next summer - 363GL, as mentioned in (2) above - in 4 months. In a bad year, it could take at least 2 rainy seasons.
- If we want to have enough water in the dams to have some backup in case we have another bad winter, we need at least 443GL in the dams at the start of the next dry season in October this year. We could achieve this with one good wet season.

*\* GL = "Giga-litres, or 1 billion litres"*
