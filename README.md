It's a dire situation. Cape Town is currently in the grips of a devastating draught. This is probably not new to you if you live here. The severity of the situation makes understanding it important. The more informed we are, the better prepared we will be. And helping people appreciate how low our supply of water is will encourage them to be more vigilant in saving it.

There is an interesting article at the CSAG [here](http://www.csag.uct.ac.za/2017/10/24/waiting-for-the-rain/) which estimated at the time that the dreaded 'day'zero', when the city runs of water, could come as soon as the middle of April 2018. There is [another website](http://www.csag.uct.ac.za/2017/10/24/waiting-for-the-rain/), which places it at 4 May as of the time of writing. It's all pretty scary stuff.

I would like to analyse the available data in an attempt to:
- Provide my own estimate for when the city will run out of water.
- Determine what a 'sustainable' dam capacity is. In other words, how high do the dams need to be going into summer *next year* to obviate our running out of water in 2019?
- Estimate how long will it take for us to get back to that 'sustainable' dam capacity, given different scenarios of water usage and weather conditions.

Life has a way of getting in the way of our aims but I'll start small and see how far I get.
