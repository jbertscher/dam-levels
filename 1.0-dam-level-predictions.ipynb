    "# When will we run out of water?\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been estimates for when the city will run out of water - notably from the [CSAG](http://www.csag.uct.ac.za/2017/10/24/waiting-for-the-rain/) and [this](http://www.howmanydaysofwaterdoescapetownhaveleft.co.za/) website. While the latter doesn't disclose how they arrived at their number, the former, written by [Piotr Wolski](http://www.csag.uct.ac.za/author/pwolski/) does. My approach will follow his logic. My contribution here will be in providing an updated figure, based on current dam levels and usage stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that there are no meaningful inflows of water into the dams during the summer period. Then we can work out the number of days of water we have left with this simple formula:\n",
    "$$d = v/c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "+ d = number of days remaining\n",
    "+ v = current volume of water in the dams\n",
    "+ c = average daily water consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Cape Town (CoCT) published a (\"water dashboard\"](https://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/City%20research%20reports%20and%20review/damlevels.pdf), which states that the total volume of dammed water is 282,417Ml. However, the last 10% of the water is unusable, since it become impossible to extract. The total capacity is 902,598Ml, which means that we need to subtract 90,259.8Ml, which leaves us 192,157Ml remaining. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same source shows daily consumption by the City at 561Ml (Ml = \"megalitres\") per day. So we almost have everything we need to plug in to the above formula and solve for the days. However, we only have the *City's* consumption. According to the Water & Sanitation Department, CoCT's share of total water consumption is only 40%. This is illustrated in the chart below, which can be found [here](https://www.groundup.org.za/media/uploads/documents/BusinessBriefingOnWaterCrisis9MayPeterFlowerPresentationHandout.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= resources/waterusewcwss.png style=\"width: 350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to get the *total* water consumption, we need to scale up the the consumption by a factor of 100/40 = 2.5. This means that total consumtpion is 1402.5Ml per day. This means that we have 192,157/1,402.5 = 137 days left. This puts 'day zero' at 19 May 2018."
